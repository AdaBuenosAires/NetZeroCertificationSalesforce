## Net Zero Cloud Fundamentals

Expectations from Key Stakeholders Are Changing:
- Investors Want Transparency and Action
- Customers Want Ethical Practices
- Employees Are Drawn to Values

This means companies have to focus on sustainability and commit to a future where global temperatures rise no more than 1.5° Celsius. To do this, they need to pay attention to their carbon footprints and offsets.

> **Carbon footprint** - An individual or organization’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.

> **Net Zero** - A net zero world is a world in balance. Achieving net zero on a global level means emitting no more greenhouse gases than we are able to remove, either by natural means or through technological solutions.

### Evidences and Effects of Climate Change

- **Global Temperature Rise**: The planet's average surface temperature risen +1 degree Celsius, driven mainly by increased carbon dioxide emissions.
- **Warming Ocean and Ocean Acidification**: The ocean has absorbed much of the heat (earth store 90% of extra energy in the ocean). The carbon dioxide is absorbed in the ocean.
- **Extreme Events**: Increased frequency of heat waves, intense rainfall events, hurricanes.
- **Glacial Retreat and Decreased Snow Cover**: Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world and the amount of snow cover has decreased, melting earlier.
- **Sea Level Rise**: Global sea level rose about 20 cm in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century and accelerating slightly every year.

### Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)

The largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions comes from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.

Primary greenhouse gases:

- **Water vapor (H2O)** - The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to the climate. Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation.
- **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)** - A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 48% since the Industrial Revolution. The primary GHG emitted by human activities!
- **Methane (CH4)** - A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.
- **Nitrous Oxide (N2O)** - A powerful GHG produced by soil cultivation practices, fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning.
- **Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)** - Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number of applications, but now largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute to destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.

### Emissions Scopes

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol has established an emissions inventory that categorizes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to outline direct and indirect emissions sources:

- **Scope 1 – All Direct Emissions**: emissions that result from diret activities of the company, such as fuel combustion from facilities and vehicles that the company owns or controls.

- **Scope 2 – Indirect Emissions**: emissions that result from the generation of purchased energy consumed by the company, such as purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling. Divided into location-based and market-based categories.

- **Scope 3 – All Other Indirect Emissions**: from activities of the organisation, occuring from sources that they do not own or control. These are usually the greatest share of the carbon footprint, covering emissions associated with business travel, procurement, waste and water.

The GHG Protocol has identified 15 distinct categories of scope 3 emissions, which can be divided into two groups:
-	**Upstream emissions**: Indirect GHG emissions related to purchased or acquired goods and services, or other activities that are considered inputs to producing a set of goods or services.
- **Downstream emissions**: Indirect GHG emissions related to the use and distribution of products and services.

### How to reach Net Zero

- Commit publicly to the shared, global goal of achieving a just and equitable transition to net zero, in line with a 1.5°C future (by 2050).
- Prioritize reducing emissions as quickly as possible and aligning the full value chain (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) to the global trajectory of ~50% emissions reductions by 2030, and near-zero emissions by 2040.
- Compensate for any remaining emissions by purchasing renewable energy and carbon credits of high credibility, impact, and co-benefits, in the long-term using removal credits only and in the near term using a combination of avoidance and removal credits.

> **Carbon Credit** - A permit that allows the company that holds it to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. One credit permits the emissions of a mass equal to one ton of carbon dioxide (CO₂).

Begin by building a **Climate Action Plan** to define and communicate a company’s strategy in support of its net zero goal. The plan should answer 3 questions:

Salesforce Climate Action Plan led to 6 priorities:

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

In December 2015, 196 countries reached an exciting landmark agreement to reverse climate change and to accelerate and expedite the actions and increase the investments needed for a sustainable, low-carbon future referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement had a central aim to limit global temperature increases to below 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5˚C).

In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly put forth **17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, also known as the Global Goals, designed to call attention to and address the extreme poverty, growing inequality, and changing climate that affect communities throughout the world.

The 2015 gathering in Paris made world history, solidifying the belief that climate change is a global issue that transcends borders. Participating countries agreed to:  
- **Adopt the Sustainable Development Goals** as a roadmap to end poverty, inequality and achieve environmental sustainability by 2030.
- **Provide adequate funding and resources** to groups impacted by the effects of climate change, including developing countries.
- **Innovate** to adopt new technology frameworks that reverse global warming.

The SDGs build upon the **8 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)**: a set of goals established in 2000 with a deadline of 2015. The MDGs covered fewer causes and only applied to developing countries, the SDGs are more comprehensive and ambitious, and apply universally to all 193 countries who are members of the UN.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92624966/174438393-40e0eddb-bc15-48d0-9954-cb50a2facc08.png)

The SDGs are designed to be universal, integrated, and inclusive:
-	**Universal**: Eradicating extreme poverty and building a sustainable future are challenges all countries face.
- **Integrated**: The SDGs integrate all three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social, and environmental) with an underlying consideration for people, planet, peace, prosperity, and partnership.
- **Inclusive**: The SDGs pledge to leave no one behind, meaning that no goal is met unless it’s met for everyone. That means putting the needs and interests of the furthest behind first.

In addition to the 3 qualities listed above, the SDGs embody 5 core principles:
1) **A Unified and Unifying Plan of Action** - The SDGs orient governments and individuals towards unified action. Our world is more innovative, connected, and fast-growing than ever before. It’s essential to have one north star in order to focus on what really matters and ensure no one is being left behind. The target “finish line” for the SDGs is 2030.
2) **Holding Governments Accountable** - The SDGs are a way to hold governments accountable, with each of the 193 UN member states agreeing to the framework. Citizens, including educators, youth, and even children, can play an important role in monitoring how goals are implemented and putting pressure on governments to ensure that the most marginalized groups are reached.
3) **Bringing the World Together** - The SDGs are built on the idea of partnership. Achieving them is impossible without the cooperation and participation of everyone. They were created by the people, for the people, through one of the widest participation processes in history. Civil society (people like you simply getting involved) played an important role in the design phase of the goals—over 500,000 people participated through debates and consultations.
4) **Universality** - The SDGs concern each and every one of us. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by world leaders in September, 2015 at an historic UN Summit, demonstrates that for all our cultural, economic, and political differences, we all share certain universal ideals and rights. The Global Goals are an opportunity to change the world for the better, and they depend on action. Specifically, they depend on joint, sustained, and early action.
5) **Accelerating the Sustainable Development Goals, Together** - The idea of a collaborative approach to solving these global challenges is not new but it is now being approached differently. There are increased innovative cross-sector partnerships emerging across the globe to address the SDGs. The idea is to empower each other to achieve them, and to create more comprehensive collective impact—together.

The **2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development** is the basis of the SDGs and represents a shared global vision. The 5 dimensions of the 2030 Agenda —Prosperity, People, Planet, Peace, and Partnerships (The 5 P’s) — articulate the scope of this vision.

In November 2021, leaders convened in **Glasgow** for **COP26** with the intention for countries to accelerate action toward the goals of the Paris Agreement and complete the Paris Rulebook. The conference did not deliver the action and commitments to reach the Paris agreement, but it elevated the urgency and kept the target of 1.50C still attainable, yet only with further action beyond the pledges made at Glasgow.

**Salesforce’s dedicated sustainability program** addresses:
- SDG 4: Quality Education
- SDG 5: Gender Equality
- SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy
- SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
- SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
- SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
- SDG 13: Climate Action
- SDG 15: Life on Land

**Salesforce Impact**:
- Reimagining Our Energy Systems
- Eating Smarter 
- Protecting Our Fresh Water Systems
- Saving the Oceans
- Equality Through Climate Justice

### Carbon Accounting
Carbon accounting is the process of calculating a company’s overall greenhouse gas emissions. Companies should calculate an initial emission benchmark and track reduction efforts across time (for example, annually).

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92624966/174602147-f230a6f1-4548-490c-af97-3a70f143d810.png)

### Emissions Reporting

Emissions reporting is a difficult process for companies:
- **No single source of truth**: Disparate sources of data often lead to a confusing and incomplete picture of energy-using activities.
- **Time-consuming and manual data tracking**: Organizing energy use data takes a significant amount of time. Some organizations aren’t tracking their carbon footprint at all. Other organizations are trying to work with environmental data in siloed systems or in spreadsheets. Even if an organization tracks this data, it can take 6 to 8 months to collect data from the previous fiscal year.
- **Poor data reliability**: Data reliability comes under scrutiny because of the series of calculations the data is put through for each emissions category. It becomes a barrier in reporting, as auditing can take months to complete.
